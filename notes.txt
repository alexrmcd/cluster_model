------------- Notes for Coding---------------


//////// radioCalc.cpp ////////



L (~74) psynIntegrate()
		
		bfield 
		nu 
		pass z?
		pass E? (for testing, needs to be ~10-100) ------- pass E in diffusionEq.cpp
L(~120) psyn()
		
		dndeeq ----
		sin(degrees or rad?)



//////// diffusionEq.cpp ////////


default vals 4-17-16 ---- ns = 100, Coma rh = 0.415 , rdv in kpc



THink main problem is error in integration, work with gsl library? time is likey an issue, very rudimentary test show them on par but with gsl slightly longer, at 1000 steps

parameters to pass, z, rh (or store with z somehow?), root_dv for testing various values. 

May be good idea to take 0 -> 1e-16 for all integration, for consisiitency

header file for constants


function for root_dv

L(~76) U()
		pass r



L(~250) ssynIntegrand()
	
		z declared in function, best as param?
