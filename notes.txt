L (~74) psynIntegrate()

		nu 
		pass z?
		pass E? (for testing, needs to be ~10-100) ------- pass E in diffusionEq.cpp

//////// diffusionEq.cpp ////////


for ds, pass mx as *(double*) params

still need to make values accessible to other functions, get(val)?

make integration for other functions, 
	gslInt_dist(), 
	gslInt_ssyn()
	gslInt_greens()
	gslInt_jsyn()
	gslInt_psyn()



uster
set_dsparams(mx, ch, yieldk, istat, etc...)



integrate(double E, void * params ){
	set_dsparams(E)
}



DS CHannel 13 only working for mx >= 75.4445






default vals 4-17-16 ---- ns = 100, Coma rh = 0.415 , rdv in kpc

define a funtion : save a few instances of redefining dist_z, bloss, psynintegrand  still use z

double 	func dist_z(){
			double z = !!!!;
			double dist_z  = Dist()/(1+z);
			return dist_z;
		}


Greens(r, rdv, ns) ---- dont need rdv as a parameter


ns-----probably be removed a s a parameter altogether using GSL


look into pulling rho(r) out of greens, using it only in ssynintegrand ?? might be more work than its worth though....










THink main problem is error in integration, work with gsl library? time is likey an issue, very rudimentary test show them on par but with gsl slightly longer, at 1000 steps

parameters to pass, z, rh (or store with z somehow?), root_dv for testing various values. 

May be good idea to take 0 -> 1e-16 for all integration, for consisiitency

header file for constants


function for root_dv

L(~76) U()
		pass r



L(~250) ssynIntegrand()
	
		z declared in function, best as param?

	MAIN OBJ --- figure out way to pass one parameter (E) into dshayield. ie, function that takes in all params, (mwimp, ch, yieldk, etc), wrap it in function that only takes E,
